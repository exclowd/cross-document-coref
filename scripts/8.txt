Hooded youths hurled petrol bombs at stores and businesses in the centre of the capital , Athens , and demonstrators tried to storm parliament during the general strike , as the rioting spread to the northern city of Thessaloniki . Police said two women and one man died at a branch of the Marfin bank which caught fire after hooded youths broke a window and hurled petrol bombs inside . Around 20 more people had to be ushered to safety . At least two other buildings , one used by tax officials , caught fire in other firebomb attacks on the margins of the protests . Athens underground stations were shut and the international airport deserted as tens of thousands of union members rallied on the eve of a vote in parliament on the planned cuts and tax rises . The general strike was the first major test of the Socialist government's resolve to push through unprecedented measures since agreeing an ? 110 billion ( Dh472 . 72bn ) debt bailout from the EU and the International Monetary Fund at the weekend . Prime minister George Papandreou's insistence that the measures are vital for the nation's survival failed to dissuade unions from paralysing public transport and preventing ferries from leaving docks . After rallying in two separate demonstrations in central Athens , members of the main unions began converging on parliament , where the government was preparing for the measures to be voted on Thursday . "They're taking everything from me , I don't know how I'm going to get by , " said 61 - year - old Anargyros Bizianis , a municipal worker in the Athens suburb of Piraeus who earns ? 900 ( Dh4 , 275 ) a month . As the protesters tried to break through a police line in front of parliament , they first hurled stones and bottles of water , prompting the riot squad officers to fire back with tear gas . Full - scale clashes soon then erupted outside the building , with riot police trying to disperse the crowds with baton - charges . During the unrest , one protester threw a petrol bomb . Youths also went on the rampage in other parts of the capital , with several dozen youths hurling petrol bombs at stores and banks , and smashing shop windows and bus shelters with iron bars . Athens police chiefs mobilised all their forces , including those not on active duty , by declaring a general state of alert . The protesters in Thessaloniki targeted stores and banks in the city centre before they were dispersed by anti - riot police . A group of about 200 communists had stormed the Athens Acropolis yesterday , unfurling banners reading "Peoples of Europe , Rise Up . " The head of the million - member strong GSEE private sector union , Giannis Panagopoulos , said : "The Greek people have been called to make sacrifices while the rich pay nothing . " A government official downplayed the unrest saying that "for years there's been strikes and protests in this country without much consequence . " But markets reacted to the violence with alarm as Greek stocks plunged 5 . 4 per cent . The government , pushed to the brink of default , agreed at the weekend to slash spending and jack up taxes in return for ? 110bn in loans over three years from eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund . Among the major measures , the government is to cut 13th and 14th month bonus pay for civil servants and retirees ; require three years more for pension contributions ; and raise the retirement age for women to 65 , the same level as men . After months of hesitation , eurozone countries and the IMF agreed to lend Greece billions of euros at below market rates after concerns that the Athens government's debt crisis could trigger a knock - on effect elsewhere . The German Chancellor , Angela Merkel , fighting accusations of holding up the bailout , said today that the Greek crisis underlined the need for an overhaul of the EU's fiscal rules . "The future of Europe and the future of Germany within Europe is at stake , " she told a debate on Berlin's decision to lend ? 22 . 4bn to Greece .

A Woodburn police officer and state police bomb squad technician were killed , while the city 's police chief remained in critical condition after a bomb exploded late Friday at a Woodburn bank . The FBI and ATF offered a $ 35,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the explosion and deaths , Oregon State Police said . The explosion happened at the West Coast Bank on the Newberg 214 Highway just before 5:30 p.m. , Marion County deputies said .

http : usatoday30 . usatoday . com news world 2010 - 05 - 05 - greece - strike - crisis _ N . htm Three die in bank during Greek riots Updated 5 5 2010 1 : 41 PM Riots over harsh new austerity measures left three bank workers dead and engulfed the streets of Athens on Wednesday , as angry protesters tried to storm parliament , hurled Molotov cocktails at police and torched buildings . Police responded with barrages of tear gas . Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in a nationwide strike to protest new taxes and government spending cuts demanded by the International Monetary Fund and other European nations before heavily indebted Greece gets a euro110 billion ( $141 billion ) loan package to keep it from defaulting . The three bank workers a man and two women died after demonstrators set their bank on fire along the main demonstration route in central Athens . As their colleagues sobbed in the street , five other bank workers were rescued from the balcony of the burning building . "A demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another ! " Prime Minister George Papandreou thundered in Parliament during a session to discuss the spending cuts he announced Sunday measures even the IMF has called draconian . Lawmakers held a minute of silence for the dead the first deaths during a protest in Greece since 1991 . "We are all concerned by Greece's economic and budgetary situation but at this time our thoughts are with the human victims in Athens , " European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said in Brussels . A senior fire department official said demonstrators prevented firefighters from reaching the burning building , costing them vital time . "Several crucial minutes were lost , " the official said , visibly upset . "If we had intervened earlier , the loss of life could have been prevented . " He asked not to be identified pending an official announcement . In Berlin , German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the Greek bailout critical for all of Europe . "Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , " Merkel told lawmakers in Berlin , urging them to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout euro22 billion ( $28 billion ) over three years by Friday . "We are at a fork in the road . " Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the help . In Brussels , European Union officials desperately tried to calm market fears that Greece's debt crisis was spreading to the rest of Europe , insisting it was a "unique case" combining profligacy and tampered accounts . Van Rompuy insisted the growing debt problems in Spain and Portugal had "absolutely nothing to do with the situation in Greece . " "Greece is a unique and particular case in the EU" because of its "precarious debt dynamics" and because it "has cheated with its statistics for years and years , " EU Commissioner Olli Rehn said . But Moody's Investor Services , a major ratings agency , put Portugal's bond rating on review for possible downgrade Wednesday . Spanish and Portuguese bonds and stocks slumped further on the news , reflecting fears that they may also have trouble repaying their debt and that the eurozone would have to extend even larger bailouts to them . On the streets of Athens , demonstrators chanted "Thieves , thieves ! " as they attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . Tear gas drifted across the city center as rioters hurled paving stones and fire bombs at police . Firefighters extinguished blazes at least two buildings the bank and a branch of the Finance Ministry while protesters set up burning barricades and torched cars and a fire truck . Police said 12 people were injured in the riots . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services , and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed and journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts . But media later broke the strike to report on the deaths and the protests . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center and some youths smashed store windows . Union reaction over austerity measures until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , despite several previous strikes . But anger mounted after Papandreou announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants and another round of consumer tax increases . Papandreou said he has no choice but to implement the measures if Greece was to avoid bankruptcy . "There was only one other solution for the country to default , taking the citizenry with it . And that would not have affected the rich , it would have affected workers and pensioners , " he told Parliament on Wednesday . "That was a real possibility , however nightmarish . " Under the bailout package , Greece will receive loans over three years from the IMF and the other 15 countries who share the euro currency . The rescue aims to prevent Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the euro . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Even with the bailout , many economists think Greece will eventually default on or restructure its debts because its prospects for economic growth are so poor over the next several years , hurting government revenue . Some fear the austerity measures insisted upon by the EU and IMF could make prospects for growth even worse . Unions say low - income Greeks will suffer disproportionately from the latest austerity measures , which aim to save euro30 billion ( $40 billion ) the country's current budget deficit through 2012 . "These people are losing their rights , they are losing their future , " said Yiannis Panagopoulos , head of GSEE , one of the two largest unions . "The country cannot surrender without a fight . " IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn warned that the crisis could spread to other countries despite the rescue package's efforts to contain it . "Everyone must remain extremely vigilant" to this risk , Strauss - Kahn said in an interview in French newspaper Le Parisien Wednesday . "I completely understand the Greek population's anger , its incomprehension at the size of the economic catastrophe , " Strauss - Kahn said . But , he said , Greeks must also understand that without these measures "the situation would be infinitely more serious . " The draft bill of the new austerity measures is to be voted on Thursday . Papandreou's Socialists hold a comfortable majority of 160 in the 300 - seat Parliament and the bill is expected to pass easily .

http : libcom . org news war - zone - athens - three - people - dead - many - buildings - burning - general - strike - march - turns - battle - War - Zone Athens : three people dead , many buildings burning as general strike march turns into a battle May 5 2010 15 : 14 Three people have suffocated to death as a result of a fire in Marfin Bank during ongoing battles between anti - measure protesters and police in Athens . The Athens protest march marking the zenith of the general strike called for the 5th of May was attended by an approximate 200 , 000 ( 20 , 000 which is the foreign broadcast number referring to the PAME march alone ) , although because of lack of media coverage due to the media participation in the general strike no concrete estimates can be made . After the PAME ( Communist Party union ) protesters left Syntagma square , the first lines of the main march started arriving before the Parliament with the first clashes erupting at the end of Stadiou street . The march then walked on the Unknown Soldier grounds leading the Presidential Guard to retreat , and attempted to storm the Parliament but was pushed back by riot police forces which today demonstrated a particularly staunch attitude and resolve against the demonstrators . Soon battles erupted around the Parliament with protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks , with one riot police armored van torched , and the police responding by extended use of tear gas that soon made Athens' atmosphere unbearably acrid . As more blocks reached Syntagma square , the battles spread across the city center and lasted for more than five hours . During the clashes several state buildings were set ablaze including the County Headquarters of Attika . At the time of writing the Ministry of Finance is reported to be on fire , and vital tax documents as destroyed by the raging fire . However the strange thing is that it is the fourth floor of the building that is burning , at a height inapproachable to petrol bombs . The building is in danger of total collapse . According to news reports that began at 14 : 00 Greek time after , under pressure by the events , most radio and TV stations decided to break their strike , claim that the fire at Marfin Bank's Stadiou street branch that has led to the death of three workers ( one a pregnant woman ) was started by protesters . However this remains an unsubstantiated claim . A similar case three decades ago had originally put the blame for the fire at Kappa - Marousi building on Panepistimiou street , leading to the death of several people inside , to anarchists , while its was later proved the fire was caused by tear gas fired by the police . After the tragic death of the three workers made the round of Athens , new clashes started to spread in the Greek capital , with a large crowd gathered outside the burned bank when Marfin's boss tried to visit the site . Clashes broke out between the crowd and police when the former attacked the bank magnate accusing him of forcing the dead workers to scab on a general strike and locking them in the building despite them demanding to evacuate it since 12 : 00 . In Parliament the Communist Party of Greece has accused the government for the deaths , claiming it was a result of agents provocateur fascist groups . The claims of the Communist Party are based on the fact that 50 fascists tried to enter the PAME demo bearing the flags of the union earlier in the morning . The fascists were spotted , chased and sought refuge behind riot police lines . Accusing the extreme - right as being behind the deaths , the Coalition of Radical Left has declared in Parliament that the government cannot pretend to be in grief for the loss of life , as it has been attacking human life by all means possible . Meanwhile , extended clashes broke out in Salonika where approximately 50 , 000 people marched destroying dozens of banks and corporate shops in Greece's second largest city . Clashes with the police continued for several hours . According to news broadcasts anarchist have occupied the Labour Center of the city . In Patras , around 20 , 000 protesters were joined by tractor drivers and garbage truck drivers on their vehicles , as flaming barricades were erected along central streets of the city and clashes developed between protestors and the police . In Ioannina the protesters attacked banks and corporate shops leading to extended use of chemicals by the police . In Heraklion , 10 , 000 people are reported as marching against the measures . In Corfu , protesters taking part in the anti - measures march occupied the County Headquarters . Protesters have occupied the Administrative Headquarters of Naxos and the City Hall of Naoussa . As a result of the Athens riots , the police have cordoned off the entire center of the city , erecting check points of entry and exit , while all police work permits have been recalled . At the time of writing battles continue to rage in the inner city , while news broadcasts claim the police is mobilising its forces to storm an anarchist squat in Exarcheia .

Gregg Hastings . A hospital representative said Russell , a 20-year veteran of the department with two daughters , is in an intensive care unit this morning . Hastings this morning announced that the ATF and FBI are offering a $ 35,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual responsible for the crime . He described those responsible as `` very dangerous . '' `` That person needs to be found as soon as possible , '' Hastings said during the somber press conference this morning . A bank employee suffered non-life threatening injuries . The other identities were not released . Marion County deputy medical examiner Rodge Womack said police were concerned there might be a second bomb in the area ; police dogs and a robot were combing the area late into the night . An undetermined number of people living within a block of the bank were evacuated from their homes Friday , and a quarter-mile area around the crime scene was cordoned off . The bank had been evacuated before the bomb detonated , according to West Coast Bank Chief Executive Robert Sznewajs . The branch has been there for at least 10 years , he said . The blast came several hours after someone made a threatening phone call to Wells Fargo around 10:30 a.m. Oregon State Police , the FBI and Woodburn police responded to the call . Police did not provide much detail about what transpired between then and 5:30 p.m. , when the bomb went off at West Coast Bank . But according to Sznewajs , two bomb threats came into the two banks , which sit side by side on Oregon 214 . Police responded to both , but it was an employee who found a suspicious device under the bushes outside West Coast bank . Sznewajs told The Statesman Journal that his bank for a call `` from an unknown person saying that we should look for one as well . We called authorities , but they looked and found nothing . '' Sznewajs said that `` one of our people saw a device in the bushes around the branch and called authorities . We looked at it and evacuated the branch and sent people away . '' He said authorities decided to move the device inside the branch and apparently scanned it -- and then it went off . Sznewajs said he did not know whether the bomb went off on its own or as a result of the technicians ' investigation . After the blast , officers closed down a large swath of the commercial strip , populated by gas stations , fast food shops and strip malls . Marion County Sheriff Russ Isham said the area will remain closed through the weekend , adding that he did not know if there could be additional bombs . Police ask anyone with information to call the ATF at 800-800-3855 . Investigators for the FBI and the ATF were dispatched to the scene . Police said early today that a multi-agency investigation involving federal , state , county and city police agencies has begun to identify suspects . The blast shook up area residents . Bob Currie , 66 , a resident of Panor Senior Condominiums which overlooks the Wells Fargo branch , said that in the morning he saw a police car blocking the drive-up teller window and an FBI bomb technician checking a garbage can in the parking lot . He said the Wells Fargo evacuated at 1:30 p.m. and he saw people leaving the bank from his balcony . Later in the afternoon , `` I went back to my computer and all of a sudden heard this loud ka-boom . '' T.J. Simons , 17 , who works at the 76 station on Oregon 214 about 500 feet from the bank , also heard the blast . `` At first I thought it was thunder , until I saw all the cops showing up . '' `` It sounded like somebody tossing a Dumpster off a three-story building , '' said Jan Olson , who was smoking on her deck in the nearby Evergreen Estates apartment complex .

http : www . abc . net . au news 2010 - 05 - 05 3 - dead - after - protesters - torch - greek - bank 423816 3 dead after protesters torch Greek bank Updated Thu 6 May 2010 , 9 : 03am AEST Three people died in a burning bank as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Athens during a general strike over the Greek government's planned spending cuts . Some protesters tried to storm parliament while others threw petrol bombs at police and torched buildings in protest against new austerity measures and a decision to raise taxes to meet the conditions of its international bailout . A petrol bomb hurled at an Athens branch of the Marfin Investment Bank killed two women and a man who were caught in the resulting inferno . It was always going to be hard to convince Greeks that ripping $43 billion out of their public services and hiking their taxes was a necessary consequence of the international bailout . As the Greek prime minister George Papandreou looked out from his parliamentary office , he saw exactly how angry they were . "We are all deeply shocked by the unjust death of three of our citizens - citizens that were victims of a raw , murderous act , " Mr Papandreou said . A professor of economics at the University of Athens , Yanis Varoufakis , did not go to work today because it was not safe . But he rode his bicycle into the city to survey the aftermath of the day's mass demonstration . "What I did witness was the battlefields after the troops had departed , " he said . "There were a few still burning or smoking cars , a couple of fire engines that had been torched , a building that belongs to the finance ministry - not far away from home - was completely burned down . "Otherwise , it was an empty city without people . " Professor Varoufakis blames angry youths for the violence and deaths . "It seems it was a large demonstration , which unfortunately was infiltrated by the usual band of 100 or 200 professional [ trouble - makers ] , " he said . "They're the ones who created the circumstances for the death , the tragic death and loss of those three people . " But Professor Varoufakis says there is "a very deep sense of injustice" across Greece . "In the foreign media , even the local media , there is a portrayal of the Greek people living above their means , who are lazy , who are not working . The truth , as always , is quite different from appearances , " he said . "This is a country of incredibly hard - working people , people who have two and three jobs in order to make ends meet . "Greece is also a country with the highest degree of poverty outside of Latvia in the whole of Europe , not just the eurozone , and it is a country in which a great deal of money was made over the last 10 - 20 years , but it was highly concentrated in a very small percentage of the population . "The rest have been struggling through the good times , through times of economic growth , to survive . Not to have a good life but just to survive , and they are the ones who now have to foot the bill for the economic collapse . " As Athens burned , many in Berlin were still fuming about having to foot most of the bill for Greek profligacy . German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed parliament , raising her voice above the catcalls and angry hecklers from the opposition parties . "This is about nothing less than the future of Europe and with it the future of Germany in Europe , " she said . Approval ratings for the chancellor have dropped six points since the aid package for Greece was announced . Ms Merkel might pay a higher political price on the weekend when crucial regional elections are held .

http : uk . reuters . com article 2010 05 05 uk - greece - idUKLDE6440NQ20100505 Greek anti - austerity march erupts in violence , 3 dead Wed May 5 , 2010 7 : 12pm BST Three people , one of them a pregnant woman , were killed when Greeks protesting against government austerity measures threw petrol bombs at a bank in Athens on Wednesday . Tens of thousands of striking workers and civil servants took to the streets and masked youths clashed with police in riot gear , who responded with steady rounds of tear gas and flash bombs which clouded the city centre . It was the worst violence to hit Greece since riots in 2008 . The violence was a blow to Prime Minister George Papandreou's plans to push through tough budget cuts demanded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund in exchange for a 110 billion euro ( 93 . 6 billion pound ) aid package unveiled on Sunday . Police said two women and one man , between 30 and 40 years old , working for a Marfin bank branch choked on smoke after protesters broke the windows of a commercial building on central Stadiou Avenue and tossed in Molotov cocktails . Marfin bank officials told Reuters one of the female victims was pregnant . Firemen had to restrain a distraught elderly woman outside the bank , who wept and cried "my child , my child . " Papandreou expressed shock at the deaths and vowed to bring those responsible to justice . "We are deeply shocked by the unjust death of these three people , our fellow citizens , who were victims of a murderous act , " he told parliament . He also defended his austerity plans , which foresee 30 billion euros in savings mainly from cuts in wages and pensions , and said the government would not abandon its drive to save the country from ruin . "We took these decisions to save the country , " he said . "The alternative would be bankruptcy . " BIGGEST PROTEST Protesters tried to storm parliament but were pushed back by riot police shortly before it started to debate the austerity bill . Opposition conservatives are refusing to support it , but the government , which enjoys a comfortable majority , hopes to pass it by the end of the week . Police put the march , to mark a 24 - hour nationwide strike , at roughly 30 , 000 people . But witnesses said there were more than 50 , 000 - - easily the biggest protest since Papandreou took office last October and launched efforts to reform an economy that is uncompetitive and plagued by corruption . Hundreds of black - hooded anarchists roamed the streets , smashing store windows and hacking chunks of marble off buildings to throw at police . Although they were behind the worst of the violence , other protesters joined them in pelting police with bottles , shouting "Thieves ! " Presidential guards , who usually stand immobile in front of the assembly building , left their posts as the clashes worsened . "Our country is on the edge of the abyss , " Greek President Karolos Papoulias said in a statement . "We are all responsible so that it does not take the step into the void . " The marchers had dispersed by late afternoon , leaving streets littered with burnt out garbage containers . Dozens of shop windows were smashed , including a bookstore near the burnt bank . Two other buildings besides the bank were set on fire . Police said 18 people had been injured in the violence and 12 arrested for carrying weapons and resisting authorities . BLOW TO GOVERNMENT The EU and IMF aid was intended to calm markets and give the government time to overhaul the economy and bring down a deficit that totalled 13 . 6 percent of national economic output last year . But the euro currency and Greek assets have been pummelled by concern that social unrest could thwart government plans to push through the measures , and on fears that Greece's woes could spread to other euro zone countries such as Portugal and Spain . In past months anti - austerity protests had been fairly peaceful , but Wednesday's violence was similar to that seen in the December 2008 riots , which broke out when police killed a teenager and dragged on for weeks . Wednesday's strike grounded flights , shut shops and brought public transport to a standstill and the main public sector union ADEDY said it was planning more walkout for next week . "The big participation in the strike today and the crowds that flooded the streets of Athens . . . sent a message to the government : We will not let the EU and the IMF measures pass , " said Ilias Vrettakos , deputy head of the union . Apostolos Kolokythopoulos , a 70 - year old pensioner who lives on less than 1 , 000 euros a month , said the walkouts were needed to force the government to change course . "I agree with the strikes . If people don't react , don't protest , how will things change ? " he said . Centre - left daily Eleftherotypia warned young Greeks would rise up if nothing was done to give them hope of a future . "If nothing is done , the explosion of the angry and the disappointed will sweep everything away , " the paper said . "Have we forgotten December 2008 and become complacent ? "

http : www . foxnews . com world 2010 05 05 brigade - says - person - dead - bank - riots - demonstration Greek Prime Minister Calls Bank Workers' Riot Deaths 'Murder' Published May 05 , 2010 The Greek prime minister has denounced what he called the "murder" of three bank workers killed when the building they were in was torched during protests in Athens against harsh new austerity measures . Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that "a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . " The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting "thieves , thieves" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . "Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , " Merkel told lawmakers . "We are at a fork in the road . " Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts . Some media - - including state television and the Ta Nea newspaper Web site - - broke the strike to report on the deaths . Greek unions concede that the cash - strapped government was forced to increase consumer taxes and slash spending , including cutting salaries and pensions for civil servants . But they say low - income Greeks will suffer disproportionately from the measures , which aim to save $40 billion - - the country's current budget deficit - - through 2012 . "These people are losing their rights , they are losing their future , " said Yiannis Panagopoulos , head of GSEE , one of the two largest union organizations . "The country cannot surrender without a fight . " IMF head Dominique Strauss - Kahn warned that the crisis could spread to other countries despite the rescue package's efforts to contain it . "Everyone must remain extremely vigilant , " to this risk , Strauss - Kahn said in an interview published in French newspaper Le Parisien Wednesday . "I completely understand the Greek populations' anger , its incomprehension at the size of the economic catastrophe , " Strauss - Kahn said . But Greeks must also understand that without these measures , "the situation would be infinitely more serious , " he said . Those who are feeling the crunch are outraged that they have to pay for what they see as politicians' mismanagement of their country's economy . "We'll be on the streets every day , every day ! You never win unless you fight , " said 76 - year - old Constantinos Doganis , who gets euro345 a month from his farming pension fund . "It's our fault too , all the mistakes made by politicians over 30 years , all the people who cheat on their taxes , " he said . "But they are behaving like buzzards - - the Germans borrow money at 3 percent and then lend it to us for 5 . Why ? " Despite the strike , the draft bill of the new austerity measures is to be voted on Thursday . Prime Minister George Papandreou's Socialists hold a comfortable majority of 160 in the 300 - seat Parliament , and with a simple majority of 151 votes needed , the bill is expected to be passed easily .
