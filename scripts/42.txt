Rumors have been floating for weeks now and we knew the 8900 would be coming sometime in early '09 and tonight T-Mobile has made it official . However , the 8900 aka Curve II aka Javelin will not be hitting store shelves on the 11th or 18th according to the press release . T-Mobile is being coy and saying it 's coming sometime this month . It could happen on those dates , but T-Mobile is n't confirming anything today . No word on price either . 1Official specs after the jump:

RIM and T-Mobile USA have finally gone official with the BlackBerry Curve 8900 , just one day after the smartphone was seen in one of T-Mo 's retail stores . So now we know for sure that the new Curve will be commercially available starting February , although an exact release date and a price were not given yet . The 8900 is the thinnest BlackBerry ever built ( only 13.5 mm ) , and it 's also among the best looking smartphones to come form RIM . Add Wi-Fi , GPS , a 3.2MP autofocus camera and a nice 480 x 360 pixels display to that and you have a really cool handset . The only thing that the Curve 8900 is missing is 3G , but since T-Mobile does n't have a nationwide 3G coverage yet , I guess this is not such a big problem . While waiting for the new Berry to be available , you can enter a T-Mobile contest here , and maybe you 'll win one for free .

T-Mobile is bolstering its smartphone portfolio by picking up Research In Motion ( NSDQ : RIMM ) 's next-generation BlackBerry Curve . The Curve 8900 is the latest refresh of the popular Curve line , and it 's the thinnest full-QWERTY BlackBerry ever .

The handset should be able to multitask smoothly , as it 's powered by a 512-MHz processor. Like other BlackBerry handsets , the Curve 8900 should have strong messaging capabilities . Users can get personal and corporate push e-mail from up to 10 accounts , and there 's built-in instant messaging . Some users may be disappointed that the new Curve can not use T-Mobile 's growing 3G network , but the EDGE connection is more than capable of sending and receiving e-mails on the go . There 's also integrated Wi-Fi , and the Curve 8900 can be used for unlimited Wi-Fi calling with T-Mobile 's HotSpot Calling service . `` With rich multimedia capabilities , exceptional mobile e-mail and messaging features , enhanced Web browsing , a premium phone , and easy access to social networking communities , including Facebook , Flickr , and MySpace.com , the BlackBerry Curve 8900 helps you make the most of a busy lifestyle that spans well beyond normal business hours , '' said Mark Guibert , VP of RIM 's corporate marketing , in a statement .

RIM has been making strides with its multimedia capabilities , and the Curve 8900 is no exception . The handset will be able to play multiple types of audio , and video should look crisp with the display 's 480-by-360 resolution .
