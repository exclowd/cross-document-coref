The Aoraki Mt Cook Alpine Rescue Team worked today to recover the body of a climber after bad weather hindered efforts yesterday . The <span class="entity1">climber</span> fell in fading light <span class="entity2">yesterday</span> <span class="entity25">near</span> <span class="entity25">the</span> <span class="entity25">Mt</span> <span class="entity25">Sefton</span> <span class="entity25">Bivvy</span> , and rescue teams were unable to reach <span class="entity1">him</span> or his <span class="entity9">companions</span> due to the weather . Police are still at the scene and say more details will be released later . The first of the deaths this weekend was that of a New Zealand <span class="entity1">climber</span> who fell on Friday morning . The 36 - year - old , who had been living in Melbourne , slipped and fell approximately 200 metres down a steep ice gully as he was approaching the Tasman Saddle Hut , police said . His brother witnessed the fall and had to spend the night in a hut before rescuers could reach him . The victim was still alive when rescuers reached him , Helicopter Line pilot Jim Campbell told the Herald on Sunday . "He was very badly hurt and he'd lost his hat and gloves in the fall so he was very cold . " The rescue team had to carry the man by stretcher down a glacier , walking two hours to reach a rescue helicopter . A Westpac Rescue Helicopter from Christchurch was called to help with search and rescue co - ordination at the Mt Cook base . By the time it arrived , the man had been transported to Mt Cook Village by a local helicopter service and had been pronounced dead by paramedics . He had been planning a four - day ski tour of the area and was using the Tasman Saddle Hut as a base , police said . Mr Campbell said police told him the man was well - equipped but was not wearing crampons when he slipped . A massive rescue bid was made shortly after 11am on Friday , with members of the Aoraki Mt Cook Department of Conservation Alpine Rescue Team , Alpine Guides , The Helicopter Line , Twizel and Fairlie police and Westpac Rescue paramedics all called in to help . Constable Joseph Rush , of Twizel police , said the weather conditions were severe , with poor visibility , strong wind gusts and - 15C temperatures .

The man aged in his early 30s fell about 600m while climbing near the Mount Sefton Bivvy on Saturday afternoon . Rescue personnel were not able to reach him or his three companions , who were all from overseas , due to low light levels on Saturday , Mid - South Canterbury Area Commander Inspector Dave Gaskin said . "They managed to have a look at him and it was pretty clear that there was no signs of life and they've flown in today to retrieve the body , " he told NZ Newswire on Sunday . The other three men were rescued by about 10am on Sunday morning . "We haven't been in a position to speak to the survivors at this stage , but it appears as if their equipment and preparation was limited , " Insp Gaskin said . It was the second death in the park in two days . A 36 - year - old <span class="entity1">man</span> died about 11am on Friday after <span class="entity1">he</span> slipped and fell about 200m down a steep icy gully . The man , a New Zealander living in Melbourne , was planning to go ski touring . Two deaths so close together was unusual for the time of year , Insp Gaskin said . "We don't normally get too many climbing accidents at this time of year , it's still basically winter conditions here , so there's very little climbing done . " The climbing season generally starts about late October early November . Mr Gaskin urged people not to go into situations unprepared .
