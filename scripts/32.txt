A man with a long history of domestic violence has been accused of stabbing his mother and a former girlfriend to death and leaving their bodies in an apartment for several days . The unlit stove in the Independence Street apartment had been left on full blast , authorities said , filling it with enough natural gas to cause a significant explosion . The body of Katherine Gomes , 61 , and Robyn Norma Mendes , 48 , were discovered on Tuesday when police and firefighters responded to calls about the smell of natural gas , according to the Bristol district attorney 's office. A space heater had been left turned to high , but it did not ignite the gas . The man , Gary Gomes , 35 , is expected to be arraigned today in New Bedford District Court on two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping . Gomes was arrested on Tuesday after investigators said they found him barricaded in a room in Mendes 's apartment on Philip Street with her 12-year-old daughter . He was with the girl for at least several hours before police arrived , according to Gregg Miliote , a spokesman for the Bristol district attorney . Gomes has been incarcerated at least three times for violent crimes against women in the last four years and at one point was held for 90 days without bail as a danger to society , according to court records . The alleged fatal stabbing would be at least his third attack against Mendes . In 2005 , Gomes was convicted of beating Mendes , holding a knife to her throat , and telling her , `` you 're never going to leave me , '' according to court records . Gomes served 9 months of a 2-1/2 year sentence . He was released in 2006 and attacked Mendes again , dragging her into the woods . Police rescued her with the aid of dogs , according to court records . Mendes went back to prison for 2-1/2 years and was recently released . In 2004 , Gomes was charged with stealing a $ 500 guitar from his sister , Jean . Gomes ran into Jean and his mother a few days later and he attacked his sister , according to court records . `` Defendant became violent and began to choke the victim with both hands around her neck , '' the records state .

The suspect , Gary Gomes , 35 , of New Bedford , has a lengthy record of domestic abuse , including convictions for kidnapping and attempted murder . He was currently on probation after his latest release from criminal custody . The victims in the case have been identified as Robyn Mendes , 48 - an ex-girlfriend of Mr. Gomes - and Catherine Gomes , 61 , the defendant 's mother . Gregg Milliote , spokesman for the Bristol County District Attorney 's Office , said both women were stabbed multiple times at the Independent Street apartment in which they were found . Ms. Gomes was the tenant at the apartment . Following his arraignment in New Bedford District Court today , Mr. Gomes was ordered held without bail . At the arraignment , prosecutor Aaron Strojny said Ms. Mendes was stabbed multiple times while in bed . `` I ( heart ) you '' was written in blood on the wall and the suspect 's ID was found on a pillow , he said , and alleged the suspect later dressed Ms. Mendes and applied makeup . Ms. Gomes ' body was found under a mattress in a different room .

Mr. Gomes was found Tuesday night barricaded in a dwelling on Phillips Road in the North End where Ms. Mendes lived . Ms. Mendes ' 12-year-old daughter was also in that dwelling at the time . Police say Gomes had been at that location for `` a few hours '' before his arrest . They found a knife , which they identified as the murder weapon , behind a bookshelf .

Mr. Gomes had been released from the Bristol County House of Correction in late 2008 after serving time on a 2006 conviction of assault with intent to murder . Ms. Mendes was the victim in that case . In 2005 , he was charged with assault and battery on Ms. Mendes with a dangerous weapon , according to court records , which indicate he grabbed her by the throat , threw her down , then held a knife to her throat and told her , `` You 're never going to leave me . '' He was sentenced to 2 1/2 years , with 9 months to serve in that case . Court records also indicate a previous arrest in which Mr. Gomes was accused of assault and battery on his sister after she accused him of stealing her guitar . His mother was a witness to that incident . Ms. Mendes had obtained restraining orders against Mr. Gomes in 2005 and 2006 , according to court records . The victims ' bodies were discovered inside the Independent Street apartment Tuesday afternoon after the building 's landlord detected the odor of natural gas emanating from the second floor .
