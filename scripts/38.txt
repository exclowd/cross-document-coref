PHPSESSID=5c80dd972566daa742ed50785e366046 March 14 , 2013 - UNITED STATES - A 4 . 6 - magnitude earthquake rattled Northern California overnight Thursday , shaking residents from San Francisco to north of Sacramento . The temblor struck at 2 : 09 a . m . and was centered in Geyserville , about 20 miles north of Santa Rosa , according to the U . S . Geological Survey . USGS measurements indicated at least 20 smaller earthquakes followed throughout the morning . The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported the quake began only one mile below ground level , which is why it was felt across the region . There were no immediate reports of damage , the newspaper said . But it woke people up . More than 60 people reported to USGS's "Did you feel it ? " site , with reports ranging from San Francisco and Oakland to Lake and Yuba counties . Others reported the shaking on Twitter . Tectonic Summary - Maacama Fault The Maacama Fault is mostly a right - lateral strike - slip fault that lies north of Santa Rosa and the immediate San Francisco Bay Area and extends as far north as Ukiah . It connects to the Rodgers Creek Fault through a complex set of faults between Santa Rosa and Healdsburg , and is thought to be the northward continuation of the Hayward - Rodgers Creek Fault System . The 2007 Working Group for California Earthquake Probability assigned a total slip rate on the Maacama Fault of approximately 9 mm yr ( 1 3 inches yr ) , based on the assumption that it continues the slip on the Hayward - Rodgers Creek Fault northward . The central and northern sections of the fault have been observed to accommodate approximately 7 mm yr ( 1 4 inch year ) of creep along it . The Maacama Fault parallels and overlaps the Rodgers Creek Fault , in a geometry that is causing the ground between the faults to subside . In Sonoma County north of Healdsburg , the Maacama Fault is largely obscured by massive landslides where it passes east of Alexander Valley . The 2007 Working Group for California Earthquake Probability combined the Maacama and the Garberville Faults into single a 181 - km ( 110 mile ) long fault and determined M7 . 5 as the maximum magnitude for this combined fault system . There is very little known about the seismic history or earthquake cycle of the Maacama Fault , and as such recurrence intervals are uncertain .
